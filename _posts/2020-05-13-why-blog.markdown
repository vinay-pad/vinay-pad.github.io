I often read blogs written by others and find them both useful and entertaining. And I admire folks who actually write down their interesting thoughts. It's a surprisingly hard thing to do. Although I have wished that I could write a blog that someone might find useful, either I didn't find a topic that I felt strong enough to write about or if I did find one I didn't make an effort put my thoughts on paper.

Recently I had a change in mindset which prompted me to start writing a blog. It was that I should write something that **_I_** would find useful rather than thinking about who else would. And if it's something that would help me, I'm sure there might be atleast few others that might find some use from it. Even if that was not the case, the fact that it would be useful to me should be good a enough reason to write it down somewhere. So why not in a blog?
