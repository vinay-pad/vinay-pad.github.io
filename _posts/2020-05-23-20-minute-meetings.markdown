I have been a software engineer for most of my career, moving to engineering management a couple of years ago. What I miss the most about being a software engineer is having large blocks of time for myself where I can learn something new, have a conversation with a colleague about an idea, or simply think. Think about how each individual in the team is doing and how I can help, the areas I can grow as a manager, team processes that are working well or not, how we are contributing to the company's success, etc. The biggest hurdle to this has been meetings, which invariably consume the entire day of anyone who is in management (sometimes, unfortunately, even Individual Contributors) and robs valuable focus time away.

This is not a new topic and there have been endless discussions about why we have too many unproductive meetings, especially the ones which are unnecessarily long, have too many people and are without a clear agenda. But it is not even close to being solved, either in smaller startups or in large companies. Everyone is constantly stuck in meetings when they could be utilizing that time to do something else. In fact, many managers are secretly proud of the fact that they are in a lot of meetings but outwardly complain about it to everyone. It's important to differentiate between work and [Busy Work](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busywork)

There is also the popular concept of [maker schedule vs manager schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) introduced by Paul Graham, which seems like a valid idea but I think is named incorrectly. It's more like **maker schedule vs a business-person schedule** in my opinion. While it's perfectly valid for VCs / founders / folks who work directly with customers to work on a manager schedule, because the primary function of such a role is to meet people to help grow or sustain a business, I would argue that an engineering manager needs to work on a maker schedule. The primary function of an engineering manager is to ensure that their team is doing the best work it can and it does **not** involve only meeting as many people as possible. When I first became an Engineering Manager, I took this concept to heart and would let myself get interrupted by anything and anyone throughout the day. But I slowly realized that I was not needed in many meetings and was invited because the organizer hadn't planned the meeting well enough to think through who is really needed.

This is not a bold claim to have a solution to the above problem; rather, it is an attempt at stating a problem clearly and breaking it down so that it's easier to think about strategies to get back time in your day. 

There are mainly a few categories of meetings an engineering manager has in a day.

### Meetings within the scope of your team
- 1-1s
- standups
- incident meetings
- sprint retrospective
- sprint planning
- team/staff meeting
- one off meetings to discuss tactical issues
- Technical Design Meetings

These meetings are under your purview and you should optimize for these meetings to be productive for both you and the team. This means making most of these meetings as small and infrequent as they need to be. When they do need to occur, they need to be short, have the minimum number of people needed, and have a clear written agenda. If you use Google Calendar, you can set the default duration for a meeting you set up under Settings -> Event Settings. Set it to 20 mins. You don't need more than that if you prepare well. And if you do, then split the meeting into multiple meetings. While this means more pre-work for the organizer, it saves a tremendous amount of time for your team. It will eventually save time for you since a meeting without a clear plan only leads to more meetings. Below example should help put this into perspective.

```
1 hour meeting with 12 people = (1 * 12) = 12 people hours
Three 20 min meetings with 4 people each = (3 * 0.33 * 4) = 3.96 hours
```

That's **~8 people hours** saved. Excluding your time, of course.

Don't make your 1-1s weekly if you and your direct report don't need them to be. Make it 20 minutes instead of 30. 9 out of 10 times you would probably need < 20 minutes unless you are chatting about the meaning of life. Standups don't need to be more than 5 minutes. Move your standup updates to Slack and discuss only blockers in person. If a standup needs more than 10 minutes your team is too big. Split your team into pods/squads with their own standups. In some cases you will realize the squads/pods can become an entirely independent team. If that happens, congrats! You have made it possible for your team to work more efficiently and have better focus.

A Technical Design Meeting doesn't need to be a two-hour ordeal. A good design discussion breaks up a topic into shorter sections that can be discussed within 30 to 45 mins. It's hard to keep the attention of a room of people for more than an hour, so why bother? Split the design discussion into multiple short meetings with the relevant audience instead of having one huge meeting with every possible person you can think of. 

The rest of the meetings in the list above don't need more than 20 - 30 minutes if planned well and in many cases may not even be required.

### Meetings that are put on your calendar by other teams
- Product Planning Meeting
- Recruiting Sync
- 1-1s with Manager, staff meeting your peer group

These meetings are the trickiest to deal with. They are often put on your calendar by other teams, and it's hard to plan for these since you have less control over when and for how long a time commitment is needed. The suggestion below might seem a bit extreme, but it's more of a thought experiment to see if you can differentiate between the meetings that truly need you vs. meetings that you just are put on because the organizer hasn't planned it well enough.

Set your working hours in Google Calendar to blocks of four hours. Either 9 AM to 1 PM or 1 PM to 5 PM, and accept meetings only in those windows. Meetings outside this window are automatically rejected. This way you are guaranteed at least four hours in a day to focus on other things. If something is urgent and can't wait, set up an escalation path for the person to contact you via phone or in person. You would be surprised how many people might decide to either wait or realize you are probably not needed for the meeting because the issue is not really urgent.

### Other Meetings
- All Hands
- Show and Tell / Demos etc
- Company Financials, Roadmap meetings.

These meetings are hard to fit into the four-hour window since they usually involve a broadcast model across the entire company or multiple teams. The crucial thing here is that these meetings should be far and few, and should occur at predictable times making it easier to plan your time. I wouldn't suggest taking a strong stance against attending these meetings unless they are optional. These meetings also mean that on some days you might not be able to get the entire four-hour window for yourself. But it's still better than your entire day being at the mercy of your calendar.

### Interviews

I put interviews into its own category because I would consider this to be the only meeting that should run on the manager schedule (in PG's [maker's/manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) paradigm). That's because, as an Engineering Manager, interviewing is critical to your team's (and, in turn, your) growth and success. Also, it is hard to completely control the schedule since it is, in part, driven by the candidate's timeline, and they may not wait around to fit into your schedule. However, if you are thoughtful about why you want to hire for a particular role and plan it well you shouldn't be spending entire quarters interviewing for your team.

### Conclusion

There may not be a silver bullet that will give you back time or free up your day, and the above solutions are not the only answers to this problem. Eventually, I think it comes down to two approaches. One is to plan your day around your meetings, and the other is to plan your meetings around your day. I encourage the latter approach to ensure that you arenâ€™t controlled by your calendars.
