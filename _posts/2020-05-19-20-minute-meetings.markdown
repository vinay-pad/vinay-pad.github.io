I have been a software engineer for most of my career, moving to engineering management a couple of years ago. What I miss the most I think is just having large blocks of time for myself where I can just learn something new, have a conversation with a colleague about an idea, or just simply think. Think about how each individual in the team is doing and how I can help, think about the areas I can grow as a manager, think about team processes that are working well or not, think about how are we contributing to the company's success etc. The biggest hurdle to this has been meetings which invariably consumes the entire day of anyone who is in management. (Sometimes unfortunately even Individual Contributors) and robs valuable focus time away.

This is not a new topic and there have been endless discussions about why we have too many unproductive meetings, especially the ones which are unnecessarily long, have too many people and without a clear agenda. But it is not close to being solved even from smaller startups to large companies. Everyone is constantly stuck in meetings when they could be utilizing that time to do something else. In fact many managers are secretly proud of the fact that they are in a lot of meetings but outwardly complain about it to everyone. It's important to differentiate between work and [Busy Work](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busywork)

There also the popular concept of [maker schedule vs manager schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) introduced by Paul Graham which seems like a valid idea but I think named incorrectly. It's more like **maker schedule vs a business-person schedule** in my opinion. While it's perfectly valid for VCs / Founders / Folks who work directly with customers to work on a manager schedule because the primary function of such a role is to meet people to help grow or sustain a business I would argue that an engineering manager needs to work on a maker schedule. The primary function of an engineering manager is to ensure that their team is doing the best work it can and it does **not** only involve meeting as many people as possible. When I first became an Engineering Manager I took this concept to heart and would let myself get interrupted by anything and anyone through out the day. But I slowly realized that I'm usually not needed in more than half of these meetings and was usually invited because the organizer hadn't planned thee meeting well enough to think through who is really needed for the meeting.

This is not a bold claim to have a solution to the above problem rather an attempt at stating a problem clearly and breaking it down so that it's easier to think about strategies to get back time in your day. 

There are mainly a few categories of meetings an engineering manager has in the course of a day,

### Meetings within the scope of your team
- 1-1s
- standups
- incident meetings
- sprint retrospective
- sprint planning
- team/staff meeting
- one off meetings to discuss tactical issues
- Technical Design Meetings

These meetings are absolutely under your purview and you should optimize for these meetings to be productive for both you as well as your team. This means making most of these meetings as small and infrequent as they need to be. When they do need to occur they need to be short, have the minimum number of people needed, have a clear written agenda. If you use Google Calendar, under settings -> Event Settings you can set the default duration for a meeting you setup. Set it to 20 mins. You don't need more than that if you prepare well. And if you do then split the meeting into multiple meetings. While this means more pre-work for the organizer it saves a tremendous amount of time for your team. It will eventually save time for you as well since a meeting without a clear plan only leads to more meetings. Below example should help put this into perspective,

```
1 hour meeting with 12 people = (1 * 12) = 12 people hours
Three 20 min meetings with 4 people each = (3 * 0.33 * 4) = 3.96 hours
```

That's **~8 people hours** saved. Excluding your time of course.

Even a Technical Design Meeting doesn't need to be a 2 hour ordeal. A good design discussion breaks up a topic into shorter sections that can be discussed within 30 to 45 mins. It's hard to keep the attention of a room of people for more than an hour so why bother? It's better you split the design discussion into multiple short meetings with relevant audience than one huge meeting with every possible person you can think of. 

Don't make your 1-1s weekly if you and your direct report don't need them to be. Make it 20 mins instead of 30. 9 out of 10 times you would probably need < 20 mins unless you are chatting about the meaning of life. Standups don't need to be more than 5 mins. Move your standup updates to slack and discuss only blockers in person. If a standup needs more than 10 mins your team is too big. Split your team into pods/squads with their own standups. And in some cases you will realize the squads/pods can become an entirely independent team. If that happens, congrats! You have made it possible for your team to work more efficiently and have better focus.

Rest of the meetings in the list except for technical design meetings don't need more than 20 - 30 mins if planned well and in many cases don't even need the meeting to occur if there isn't a need. 

### Meetings that are put on your calendar by other teams
- Product Planning Meeting
- Recruiting Sync
- 1-1s with Manager, staff meeting your peer group

These meetings are the trickiest to deal with. They are often put on your calendar by other teams and it's hard to plan for these since you have less control over when and how long of a time commitment is needed. The suggestion below might seem a bit extreme but it's more of a thought experiment to see if we can differentiate between the meetings that truly need you vs meetings that you just are put on because the organizer hasn't planned it well enough.

Set your working hours in Google calendar to blocks of 4 hours. Either 9 AM to 1 PM or 1 PM to 5 PM and accept meetings only in those windows. Meetings outside this window are automatically rejected. This way you are guaranteed at least 4 hours in a day to focus on other things. If something is urgent and can't wait, setup an escalation path for the person to contact you via a text or phone call or in person. You would be surprised how many people might decide to either wait or realize you are probably not needed for the meeting because the issue is not really urgent in the true sense.

### Other Meetings
- All Hands
- Show and Tell / Demos etc
- Company Financials, Roadmap meetings.

This category of meetings are hard to fit into the 4 hour window since it usually involves a broadcast or multicast model across the entire company or multiple teams. But the crucial thing here is that these meetings should be far and few and should occur at predictable times which should make it easier to plan your time around. Hence I wouldn't suggest taking a strong stance against attending these meetings unless of course they are optional or if it's an exception. These meetings also mean on some days you might not be able to get the entire 4 hour window for yourself. But it's still better than your entire day being at the mercy of your calendar.

### Interviews

I put interviews into its own category because as an engineering manager I would consider this to be the only meeting that should run on the manager schedule (in PG's [maker's/manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) paradigm). That's because as an Engineering Manager interviewing is critical to your team's (and in turn your) growth and success and is hard to completely control the schedule since it's in part driven by the candidate's schedule as well and not all candidates will wait around to fit into your schedule. However if you are thoughtful about why you want to hire for a particular role and plan it well you shouldn't hopefully be spending your entire couple of quarters or year interviewing for your team.

In conclusion, the point I'm trying to make here is not that the above solution or any one solution is the answer to meeting problems. Every manager's situation in their company is different, and there are 2 approaches to this problem. One is that your plan your day around your meetings and the other is that you plan your meetings around your day. I encourage the latter approach here in order to ensure that we aren't controlled entirely by our calendars.
