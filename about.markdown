I currently work as an Engineering Manager at [Lob.com](https://lob.com/). I have previously been a software engineer from 2012 to 2018. I like solving problems and building products that bring joy to users. Initially I thought writing good code is the only way to do it. But I have realized over the years that it takes more than just good code to make something that others might enjoy using and even pay for. It also needs a team that works well together, can focus on the most important parts and learn & iterate. I wanted to understand this process more and get better at it. This realization led to my transition to Engineering Management in 2018.
